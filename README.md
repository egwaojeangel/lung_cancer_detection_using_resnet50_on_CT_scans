# Lung Cancer Detection System Using ResNet50 on CT Scans 🫁

## Overview
This project presents a deep learning–based lung cancer detection system
developed using Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. The system utilizes
a transfer learning approach based on the ResNet50 architecture to classify
lung CT scans as either **cancerous** or **non-cancerous**.

The trained model was integrated into a web-based application named **LUNNY**,
designed to support early lung cancer detection and assist healthcare
professionals in medical image analysis.

## Motivation
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
largely due to delayed diagnosis. Manual analysis of CT scans can be
time-consuming and error-prone, especially under high clinical workloads.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to improve diagnostic
accuracy, reduce delays, and support clinical decision-making in lung cancer
detection.

## Dataset
CT scan images were collected from three publicly available datasets:

- IQ-OTH/NCCD
- LIDC-IDRI
- BIR Lung Dataset

After balancing, a total of **1,720 CT scan images** were used:
- 860 cancerous
- 860 non-cancerous

### Data Split
- Training: 70%
- Validation: 15%
- Testing: 15%

> ⚠️ Due to size and privacy constraints, the datasets are not included in
> this repository.

## Methodology

### Image Preprocessing
- Images resized to **224 × 224 pixels**
- Converted to RGB format
- Normalization applied for stable training
- Independent preprocessing for each dataset split

### Data Augmentation (Training Only)
- Horizontal and vertical flipping
- Rotation (±10°)
- Random cropping
- Color jittering

---

## Model Architecture
- Base Model: **ResNet50 (ImageNet pre-trained)**
- Transfer learning approach
- Early layers frozen
- Final layers fine-tuned for binary classification
